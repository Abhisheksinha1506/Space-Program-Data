There are several files in this archive.  The first is the SIMH .TAP file image.  Note that only 6 bits of each byte are used (7 track tape).  
The second is the .log of the run.  
The third is the contents of the tape, block by block, translated from IBM 6-bit BCDIC to ASCII txt.

2090 reads perfectly; no issues--the data looks much like the previous tapes; 132-character records of what I'm supposing are switch legends. 
Only one single parity error (I can isolate it to a single byte). 14,404 records amounting to about 2 MB.

There is one single unrecoverable parity error noted in the log for 2090 Block 13508, the third byte is a "+", but should be a space. 
That is, it's read as 0x30, but should be 0x10. It's not a transient error; it read the same way forward and backward several times.
